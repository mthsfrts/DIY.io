## Getting Started:

So, this code is basically a chaotic hodgepodge of different programming languages and services, ranging from DevOps to Python, and it's all mashed together in one repository. It's like trying to navigate a minefield blindfolded - you never know what you're gonna get!

But fear not, brave adventurer, for if you're fluent in the languages and tools used in this repository, you might just make it out alive. Once you've got that covered, peruse the code and adjust the variables as needed for your project. And don't forget to read the code thoroughly, or you might find yourself blaming me for any messes you make. Trust me, I've seen it all.

But seriously, this code is designed to help you create a weekly schedule by filling in free time slots with random activities. The code reads in a JSON file containing fixed and random activities, and then creates a pandas dataframe to represent the weekly schedule. The fixed activities are placed in the appropriate time slots, while the free slots are filled with random activities.

To use this code, you'll need to have a basic understanding of Python and pandas. Once you've got that down, make sure you have the JSON file with your activities in the correct format. Then, adjust the variables in the code as needed (such as the days of the week and the number of hours in the day), and run the code. The output will be a pandas dataframe representing your weekly schedule.

And that's pretty much it! Good luck, and may the coding gods be with you. Or, at the very least, may the bugs be easy to find.
