This repository is a dumpster fire of code and services, including, but not limited to, DevOps, Go, Miscellaneous, and Python. It's like a buffet of programming languages and tools, you never know what you're gonna get!

## Getting Started:

First, you gotta be fluent in the languages and tools you want to use. Then, peruse the code and adjust the variables as needed for your project. Don't forget to read the code, or you'll be blaming me for any messes you make.

## Folders:

[DevOps](https://github.com/mthsfrts/DIY.io/tree/master/DevOps)- A treasure trove of templates and scripts for Ansible, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Packer, Pulumi, and Terraform.
[Go](https://github.com/mthsfrts/DIY.io/tree/master/Go) - A smorgasbord of Go code and packages for all your projects.
[Miscellaneous](https://github.com/mthsfrts/DIY.io/tree/master/Misc) - A hodgepodge of code and services that don't fit anywhere else.
[Python](https://github.com/mthsfrts/DIY.io/tree/master/Python) - A cornucopia of Python code and packages, because who doesn't love Python?

## Contributing:

Contribute if you dare, but I won't be held responsible for any damage done. See [contributing.md](https://github.com/mthsfrts/DIY.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to join the fun.

## Code of Conduct:
We aim to create a community that's welcoming and inclusive, so don't be a jerk. Check the code of conduct for more details, but here's the gist:

Be respectful and considerate of others.
Avoid using offensive language or imagery.
Don't discriminate or harass others.
Don't post confidential information without consent.
Don't troll, flame, bait, or engage in aggressive behavior.
Don't post illegal or hateful content.
Don't promote self-harm or suicide.
Violations of the code of conduct will result in consequences, including banishment from the community. If you witness a violation, report it to the repository maintainers.

## Support:
If you're stuck or found a hard coded secret key, hit me up on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mthsfrts/), [Telegram](https://t.me/Mthsfrts), or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Vw2Zk5ep5E). If you want to make changes, create a pull request. But don't expect me to be impressed by your coding skills.

And that's a wrap folks! Just remember, if you're struggling with the code or having trouble finding the key to world domination, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always here to help (or conquer the world together). And remember, if you do find the key to world domination, don't be a hero and keep it to yourself. Share the wealth, and the power. We'll rule the world as an unstoppable duo of tech geniuses and dark overlords. MWAHAHAHA!
